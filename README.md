Bridge
======

C++ application for Arduino integration. (C++ plugins)

Development: On Hold

Start Date: Summer 2014

## Why?

So, I bought an Arduino to play with hardware and get back to my lost roots of circuit boards. My goal here was to initially create a C++ motor driver that sent serial commands to the Arduino which controlled an H-Bridge chip. I got to the point where I could send commands from a console application directly through the Arduino and control a motor. 
But, I never got to the actual driving part.

Everytime I step away from this I forget about how the Arduino works and the architecture. I have to read my kindle book "Programming Arduino - Getting Started with Sketches" to get underway.
